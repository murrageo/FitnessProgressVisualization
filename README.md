Statement: 
A workout tracker and visualization tool that accepts a CSV file containing a variety of measurements related to overall health and fitness.  The tool standardizes the measurements and then visualizes changes from baseline values (or lack thereof) so as to identify areas of growth and weaknesses.  

Long-term Vision:
The tool could be expanded to automatically identify weaknesses and make recommendations to address those weaknesses based on previous data from users or public databases.  An aesthetically pleasing user interface could be created so that the tool can be delivered online or as an app.  The tool could use ChatGPT to read workout records from images and automatically incorporate them into existing visualizations without any CSV file or time-consuming data upload.  

Base Requirements:
- User-defined categories arranged visually. Drop-down menus for units. 
- Input exercise-related data as CSV
- Visualize data in information-dense yet interpretable plots
- Establish baseline for each category
- Show current level as compared to baseline
- Call attention to areas of growth (and areas of stagnation) - trend plots, i.e. up 2% in green or down 5% in red with arrows. 

Bonus Requirements:
- User interface (deployed online, on Apple and Android)
- Option to input data through image (automatic parsing) or text field on app
- Secure user data storage / ethical analytics
- Trend analysis of user data (pull in public data sources)  / ethical analytics
- Automated recommendations to accelerate improvements
- Gamification for progress and to break-through plateaus
